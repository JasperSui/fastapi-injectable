## How to report a bug

Report bugs on the [Issue Tracker].

When filing an issue, make sure to answer these questions:

- Which operating system and Python version are you using?
- Which version of this project are you using?
- What did you do?
- What did you expect to see?
- What did you see instead?

The best way to get your bug fixed is to provide a test case,
and/or steps to reproduce the issue.

## How to set up your development environment

You need to have Python 3.10, 3.11, 3.12 at the same time, you can use [pyenv] to do so, once you have installed [pyenv], you can use the following command to install the required python versions:

```console
$ pyenv install 3.10 3.11 3.12
```

And you also need the following packages:

- [Poetry]
- [Nox]
- [nox-poetry]


If you don't have any of these, you can use pip to install them directly:
```console
$ pip install -r requirements/dev.txt # Optional if you already have them
```

And then install the package with development requirements:

```console
$ poetry install
```

You can now run an interactive Python session

```console
$ poetry run python
```

[poetry]: https://python-poetry.org/
[nox]: https://nox.thea.codes/
[nox-poetry]: https://nox-poetry.readthedocs.io/
[pyenv]: https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv

## How to test the project

Run the full test suite:

```console
$ nox
```

List the available Nox sessions:

```console
$ nox --list-sessions
```

You can also run a specific Nox session.
For example, invoke the unit test suite like this:

```console
$ nox --session=tests
```

Unit tests are located in the _test_ directory,
and are written using the [pytest] testing framework.

## How to submit changes

Open a [pull request] to submit changes to this project.

Your pull request needs to meet the following guidelines for acceptance:

- The Nox test suite must pass without errors and warnings.
- Include unit tests. This project maintains 100% code coverage.
- If your changes add functionality, update the documentation accordingly.

Feel free to submit early, thoughâ€”we can always iterate on this.

To run linting and code formatting checks before committing your change, you can install pre-commit as a Git hook by running the following command:

```console
$ nox --session=pre-commit -- install
```

It is recommended to open an issue before starting work on anything.
This will allow a chance to talk it over with the owners and validate your approach.

## Troubleshootings

If you get errors about `_sqlite3` module not found:

```
    import datetime
    import time
    import collections.abc

>   from _sqlite3 import *
E   ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_sqlite3
```

You may follow this [StackOverflow solution](https://stackoverflow.com/a/76266406) to fix it by install `sqlite3-dev` in your os first, then `pyenv install` again.
